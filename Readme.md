# Tooling for finalizing a SharePoint on-prem migration 

## What to do?
- Get all SharePoint server siteCollections 
- Iterate through each and to the following 
-- Change the logo with a new one (this contains a "NEW" message and an arrow pointing to the right)
-- Add a new header navigation link "Click here for the new SharePoint" [https://yourname.sharepoint.com/site/<nameofthecurrentsite>]
-- Set the sitecollection to read only 

__Should work with SharePoint Server 2013 - 2019__
